This one looks really really cool, but it has some limitations
	Mainly the graph is fully-connected and euclidean: each city is connected to every other city, and the distance between each city is just the geometrical distance. Also- every edge is bi-directional: there are no one-way roads. If the second applies to our problem, we might be able to ignore the limitations of the first part of the problem.
